If you really wanted a quick palindrome checker, it would be a lot simpler 
to just compare a string with its reverse.  Python doesnâ€™t have a reverse()
function for strings, but it does have a way to reverse a string 
with a slice, as illustrated here:
'''
def another_palindrome(word):
    return word == word[::-1] # list[<start>:<stop>:<step>]
