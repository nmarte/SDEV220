# THINGS TO DO

# Section 6.1

# Use a for loop to print the values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0].

for n in range(3,-1,-1):
    print(n)

# 6.2 Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me, and the value 1 to the variable number.
# Write a while loop that compares number with guess_me. Print 'too low' if number is less than guess me.
# If number equals guess_me, print 'found it!' and then exit the loop. If number is greater than guess_me,
# print 'oops' and then exit the loop. Increment number at the end of the loop.
